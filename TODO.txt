- Implement native functions for i2c (later SPI and Serial)

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Move stacks from C heap into Forth heap (byte array), to enable saving state by dumping that array to EEPROM

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive mode instead

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
