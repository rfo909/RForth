	- store compiled code in onchip EEPROM that runs on restart, to load from external EEPROM,
	  using NATIVE
	  
	- or: store settings onchip for how to load HEAP image from external EEPROM followed by auto-run
	  - will be needing separate system words for doing this

 
	- store source code in 32 byte blocks, with 2 bytes next pointers and 1 status byte
	- create eval or something to process lines from EEPROM	
	
	  to implement monitoring of pins etc
	  
	- test motion detector (Pin interface)
	- test GPS receiver (Serial)
	- alnum displays i2c

- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial

- Implement breakable loops, like BEGIN ... cond BREAK ... cond BREAK ... AGAIN

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive 
	mode instead, like a pin reading HIGH or LOW

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
