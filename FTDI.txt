FTDI pinout (remember 3.3V jumper selection)

DTR RX TX VCC CTS GND

Flashed mecrisp Forth on the pico, to test the FTDI chip.

Hooked up GND, VCC (to VSYS) RX and TX.

It works. 

GNU Screen send/recv is ok, except formatting (LF only).

Minicom does not work at all. Softlinking /dev/ttyUSB0 as /dev/modem. This works on RPi 3, where I connected
directly using TX/RX GPIO pins (no FTDI), but it runs minicom 2.8, while got 2.7 on ubuntu 20 on pc.
