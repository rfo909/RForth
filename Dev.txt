2022-05-18 v0.1.1 Data Stack value types
----------------------------------------
Added support for types on stack. Keeping current functions
dsPush() dsPeek() dsPop() dsGet() but added checks so they can
only work on numeric data.

The WORD type is for word literals (to be introduced)

Fixed bug: names of local variables were not reset along with other Input resets

Modified OP_DUP to call func in Stacks which handles the new struct type values
on data stack.

Fixed bug that prevented redef. of word.
