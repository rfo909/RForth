Forth never ceases to fascinate
================================

- 2025-08 V3

It's been said that the best way of understanding Forth is to build one
yourself. This project aims at the Pi Pico as the run platform,
simply because the toolchain and the deploy is so easy. 

It is unlikely this Forth will ever be used for anything but testing
and development.

The design is making a byte code assembler, compiling the code in
the ACode.txt file into a printable string, and over time extending this
to encompass dictionaries and a Forth.
