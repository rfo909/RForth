Compile stack 
	- must not require balanced lookups
	
	DO ... (cond) IF BREAK THEN... AGAIN
	
	DO pushes an address marked with DO
	BREAK pushes a jump marked with BREAK
	AGAIN pushes a back-jump to the DO tag, then updates the BREAK jump to current offset
	
	The THEN resolves the IF, not the BREAK forward jump. 
	AGAIN resolves both itself by looking up DO and then resolves BREAK forward jump.
	At compile time!

	The addresses or the patch locations to be pushed must be tagged with type (1 byte) like
	
		IF		(push address of forward jump from IF or ELSE to THEN)
		DO		(push current address, picked up by AGAIN)
		BREAK	(push address of forward jump, resolved by AGAIN)
		
		
	When compiling an AGAIN

	-> in order to make high level simulations in the Interpreter script.

C-code
------
As with the CFT interpreter, it executes the opcodes of the instruction set. The
REPL and Forth compiler is written in the corresponding assembly language.
