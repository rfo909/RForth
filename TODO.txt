TODO
----

- IMMEDIATE words have no meaning outside compile mode, as the modifier
means "execute immediately" in compile mode.

So COLON is not immediate, as when we enter it we are in "interpreter" mode,
executing each word directly.

Certain words, such as CONSTANT have a "data space" address, which gets pushed on the
stack at execution

: CONSTANT CREATE , DOES> @ ;

The CREATE word takes a symbol from the input stream, creates a dictionary entry
with it. Then the COMMA takes a value from the stack, allocates memory for it, and
*compiles* it into code. 

The the DOES> comes along, adding code for reading the value.

Is this right??



Make abstract devices for
	GPIO
	I2c
	SPI

	-> in order to make high level simulations in the Interpreter script.

C-code
------
As with the CFT interpreter, it executes the opcodes of the instruction set. The
REPL and Forth compiler is written in the corresponding assembly language.
