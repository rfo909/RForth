	- implement the autorun string from onboard EEPROM
	- it should return the address of the word to call after executing the code, before doing a cforce return to address 0
	
	- put length of dictionary names in high-byte of status word
	- create disassembler in C that now can look up word names from the code pointer-pointer 
	- and knows length from offset -1 of code segments
	
	- create memory dump in C for listing out content complete address space	

	- alnum displays i2c

- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial

- Implement breakable loops, like BEGIN ... cond BREAK ... cond BREAK ... AGAIN

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive 
	mode instead, like a pin reading HIGH or LOW

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
