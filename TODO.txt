RTC for sleep and wake
Movement sensor PIR for sleep and wake (Christmas decorations)
	MOSFET powered by movement sensor, boots MCU
	MCU has 2 seconds to start program, pulling an output HIGH to a second MOSFET, ensuring it gets power
	It continously reads the output of the PIR.
	After a certain while since last PIR signal, the MCU dims the decoration then writes LOW to the second MOSFET
	This halts the MCU and the decoration.

	- put length of dictionary names in high-byte of status word
	- create disassembler in C that now can look up word names from the code pointer-pointer 
	- and knows length from offset -1 of code segments
	
	- create memory dump in C for listing out content complete address space	

	- alnum displays i2c

	- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial

	- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial
