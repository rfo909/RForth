TODO
----

Make the interpreter a bit more robust with regards to errors


Make abstract devices for
	GPIO
	I2c
	SPI

	-> in order to make high level simulations in the Interpreter script.

C-code
------
As with the CFT interpreter, it executes the opcodes of the instruction set. The
REPL and Forth compiler is written in the corresponding assembly language.
