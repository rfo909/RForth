Bugs:
   The compile stack must be cleaned up when all values are zeroes
   (It overflows with 3x IF THEN in a word)
   

ret?
   Extremely useful in loops, for now implement as
   
: ret? IMMEDIATE
  0xC2 EmitByte   (numeric 2 = offset)
  0x36 EmitByte   (rfwd?)
  0x52 EmitByte   (ret)
;



RTC for sleep and wake
Movement sensor PIR for sleep and wake (Christmas decorations)
	MOSFET powered by movement sensor, boots MCU
	MCU has 2 seconds to start program, pulling an output HIGH to a second MOSFET, ensuring it gets power
	It continously reads the output of the PIR.
	After a certain while since last PIR signal, the MCU dims the decoration then writes LOW to the second MOSFET
	This halts the MCU and the decoration.

	- change dictionary entry (DE) so it points to string representation instead of inlining it
	- internalize all words (to lower case) on the heap, so that dict lookup becomes pointer equality instead of streq call
	- create FIND to look up a word from string representation
	
	- create code editor as list of words + newlines + indents, with freelists (words = 4,8,16,32 minus 2 bytes for linked list)
	- move saving dump of heap to address 32k - 4k (single image)
	- use rest for code editor

	- create interpreter in Java for testing and desktop use
	
	- create disassembler in C after changing DE format
	  
	- implement lists  [ ... ]
	- implement ." ... " 

	- create memory dump in C for listing out content complete address space	

	- alnum displays i2c

	- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial

	- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial
