TODO
----

Change call instruction to have two bytes following, with the address
Basically remove the NumberTable class, use back-patching.

For local tags we let jmp and jmp? be followed by a single byte
which is a local offset


REPL and compiler
-----------------
a state machine for processing input
global state variables in memory for controlling processing
hard-coded initial dictionary linked list



Make abstract devices for
	GPIO
	I2c
	SPI

	-> in order to make high level simulations in the Interpreter script.

REPL
	requires dictionary
		requires symbol table
		
	for inspecting and setting hardware registers (new instructions)
	for testing functionality
	export added code as text?


Rewrite the C code
	interpreter for bytecode only?
