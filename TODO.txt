	- implement 0-9 hardware timers, operating at millisecond resolution
      
	  Sys.tEnable (bool timer --)
      Sys.tEnabled (timer -- bool)
	  Sys.tMillis (timer -- millis)

	- implement hardware interrupt on some pin to break otherwise forever loops
      instead of "key", use pull-down, and when high, enables timer 0

    - RForth code detects this by checking if timer 0 is enabled.

         : continue? 0 NATIVE Sys.tEnabled not ;

	- write bootloader (256 bytes) for onchip EEPROM, to load versioned and checksummed version of HEAP from
      external EEPROM, with data on i2c address, EEPROM pos, and page size, and jump to certain address, 
      or fail with blink code on internal LED

	- test saving HEAP, from address &PROTECT to HERE, on external EEPROM

	- store source code in 32 byte blocks, with 2 bytes next pointers and 1 status byte
	- create eval or something to process lines from EEPROM	
	
	  to implement monitoring of pins etc
	  
	- test motion detector (Pin interface)
	- test GPS receiver (Serial)
	- alnum displays i2c

- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial

- Implement breakable loops, like BEGIN ... cond BREAK ... cond BREAK ... AGAIN

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive 
	mode instead, like a pin reading HIGH or LOW

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
