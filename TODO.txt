	- implement key? word which returns true if receiving input on serial,
	- implement <boolean> BREAK to BEGIN AGAIN? and add AGAIN without conditional

	- test saving HEAP, from address &PROTECT to HERE, and restoring it
	- must use Forth words for this, as ACode shouldn't do NATIVE stuff

	- store source code in 32 byte blocks, with 2 bytes next pointers and 1 status byte
	- create eval or something to process lines from EEPROM	
	
	  to implement monitoring of pins etc
	  
	- test motion detector (Pin interface)
	- test GPS receiver (Serial)
	- alnum displays i2c

- Implement native functions for SPI and Serial

- Implement breakable loops, like BEGIN ... cond BREAK ... cond BREAK ... AGAIN

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive 
	mode instead, like a pin reading HIGH or LOW

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
