- Implement native functions for i2c (later SPI and Serial)

- Implement breakable loops, like BEGIN ... cond BREAK ... cond BREAK ... AGAIN
	(or create conditional return op: ret?)

- Add external 24FC256-I/P EEPROM, save code to it via "screens" editor (in firmware)

- Create a disassembler (code length byte at index -1 already in place) (?)

- Define a way to both automatically run a certain word, and some startup condition to enter interactive 
	mode instead, like a pin reading HIGH or LOW

- Consider moving interactive REPL to SoftSerial at 9600 baud or lower (?) to free up hardware serial
